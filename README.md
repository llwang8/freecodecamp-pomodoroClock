## FreeCodeCamp: Build a Pomodoro Clock

I built an interactive Pomodoro Clock with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS, while following some best practices for structuring HTML, writing efficient CSS, and commenting code along the way.

 User can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed, reset the clock for user's next pomodoro and customize the length of each pomodoro.

#Built with:

Implemented with jQuery, HTML and CSS. Also used normalize.css, digital color meter, google fonts.
