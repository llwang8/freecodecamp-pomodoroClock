## FreeCodeCamp: Build a Pomodoro Clock

I built an interactive Pomodoro Clock with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS, while following some best practices for structuring HTML, writing efficient CSS, and commenting code along the way.

 User can start a default 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed and reset itself to break setting.  User can change the setting of the clock for user's next pomodoro and customize the length of each pomodoro by clicking "-" and "+".  User can click the clock face to start / pause the clock.

# Built with:

Implemented with jQuery, HTML and CSS. Also used normalize.css, digital color meter, google fonts.
